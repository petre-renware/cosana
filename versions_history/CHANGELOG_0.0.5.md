## 0.0.5

### 028.beta (230111 19:00)

* 230111piu_e `crud_table_template.html` populate form for EDIT operation with data existing in table (PK is critical); fix all prev ERRS
* (F) 230111piu_d write code `crud_data_admin_main.py`, `FORM-RT`, `POST` method, operation `form_op_edit`
* 230111piu_c cleanup useless items / objects and fix small UI bugs

### 027.alpha (230111 08:00)

* 230111piu_b cleanup solution, save DB scripts and update documentation
* 230111piu_a **@FIXED 230110piu_f** clean `SalesProject` from system database, drop `Company` attribute, it will become subject of **ADS** - rationale:
    * a sales project can be subject of no client (a project designed for a group of customers)
    * a sales project must be flexible, at least in its inception phase to adapt to potential many challenges and changes
    * really its not the subject of COSANA (it is expected to have an external CRM for that purposes)
* (F) 230110piu_f **@BUG** write code `crud_data_admin_main.py`, `FORM-RT`, `POST` method, operation `form_op_new`
* 230110piu_e **@FIXED 230110piu_d** 230110piu_d - next is `crud_data_admin_main.py`, function `crud_data_form(operation_or_pk)`, POST method actions NEW & EDIT
* 230110piu_d **@BUG** enhance *DEF-RT* route view function to differentiate between `last_op_status` when called *"very first time"* or when called after a *FORM-RT* save (on POST request)

### 026.alpha (230110 09:00)

* (F) 230110piu_b `crud_table_template.html` prepare an area to display last operation status (if was a las operation) - normally hidden, server will place data here and and client will read data from here
* 230110piu_a `crud_form_template.html` get form fields definition from `data_models.salesproject_form_models` and put them in UI form as "draft look"
* 230109piu_a `crud_form_template.html` prepare modal body for "Bootstrap 4" like layout to accommodate Flask WTF Jinja generated controls
* 230107piu_a `crud admin... component` fixed (acceptable) for input controls
* 230106piu_c `crud admin... component` fixed general problems regarding aspect - conflicts between Data Table, Bootstrap Modal - basically generated by different jQuery versions
* 230106piu_b `crud admin_form_template.html` alter action attribute as:
    * *form_op_new* - for considering an insert into database
    * *form_op_edit* - for considering an update into database
* 230106piu_a `crud admin_form_template.html` let 2 buttons:
    * *Close* - close modal dialog doing NOTHING and no submit to server (equivalent of Cancel)
    * *Save* - making a POST submission to server and closing modal
    * and eliminate from form definition (`data_models`) the two buttons as there are no different submits modes / actions
