[TOC]

# Overview

**ARE - Account Review and Evaluation** component is designed for *sales accounts review and evaluation* from business analysis perspective by showing actual and historical status by different business domains (see *ADS* for business domains term)


# Components Description

## Files

The basic files used by component are (in a relative importance order):

* `are_main.py` - this file contains code to expose all component route and functionalities
* `init_are.py` - component initialization code (instead of automatic `__init__.py`)
* `are_start_page.html` - main component user interface (table with data and corresponding actions)
* `__init__.py` - empty file for Python packaging purposes


Also there are files specific / dedicated to each *business domain*. These are named `are_business...domain.html`, where `business...domain` is the *code-name* of corresponding business domain (see *(i2.b) area* section).

These files contains the "detail form" (ie, tab on UI) for *input / edit* data of respective business domain. Code to process the data is located in basic files, both on *server -side* and on *client-side*.

>*Note*: all HTML files are rendered from this directory (as being component specific) and from Flask template directory (except base templates).


# UI specs

## Main page

The main page contains a navigator for all business domains with evaluation data available as inside content (for tab like widgets) or link to a dedicated page (for button like widgets).

## Business domain pages

For a business domain evaluation (ARE functionality), its dedicated area / page will show historical charts with **score evolution** for minimum the following time periods:

* **last 10 days** - for last 10 days of activity
* **last 30 days** - for last 30 days of activity
* **full activity** - for full data found in database


***For calendar dates, the following rules will apply:***

* calendar dates are those contained in `_updated_at` fields from database tables / objects
* these dates will be converted to user time zone at client level, actual they being in UTC time zone at server level
* for filtering will be considered data as it in database (UTC) because for that periods differences of maximum 1 day are not relevant


***For charts, the following rules will apply:***

* charts will be generated at server level (server-side), temporary saved as `PNG` files with unique names for each user request (regardless user identification) then will be rendered tu client browser
* location for temporary saving is `APP_ROOT/tmp` directory; the process of cleaning this directory will be assured at server level OS by specific methods - it can be cleaned after each use, so considering one clean per day should be enough


# `are_main.py` code file specs

This cde contains the following functions:

* **`are_builder()`** ADS-RT [main route and UI builder] - load all detailed pages (specific content zones) HTML files and send them to client; also this function send summary data as Jinja for each business domain (score current, score maxim and max of last updated date of domain data)

* **`are_chart(business_domain, chart_type)`** ADS-CHART [chart routes]  (see component README for details) - assure sending files with all charts data as jinja data; parameters specify the requested business domain and type of desired chart (from those listed here at *Business domain pages* section)
